 Binary Search:
 To find a particular value in a given array/list by using its index value
 
 formula;
 start+end/2;
 
  example;
        // 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 -index 
  array[]={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}  
  To find value 7;
  start+end/2;
  0+9/2;
  9/2;
  4.5 ~ 4;
  To check index position of 4:
  5!=7;
  So we skip the left of the 4 index 
  because the value is greater than 4th we know.
  
 So now we take 4th index is start value and and remaining end value,
 Now,
 5+9/2;
 13/2;
 6th index 
 To Check 6th index;
 7==7;
 Return;
